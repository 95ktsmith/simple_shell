- Holberton Simple Shell.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
Holberton Simple Shell is a command line interpreter. It reads input from the user through standard input, and performs builtin functions and executes other programs accordingly.
.PP
When given a command, the shell will first look for that command as a builtin function, and perform it if a matching builtin is found. If no matching builtin is found, the shell will search the directories in the environment's PATH for a matching program, and execute it if a matching program is found. Programs executed by this shell are done so in a child process that is killed if the program fails to execute. If no matching program is found, an error message will be printed with relevant information.


.BR Builtins
